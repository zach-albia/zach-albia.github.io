To most of us who were learning programming for the first time, Scheme just wasn’t something suitable for serious, real-world™ programming.

I bemoaned having to write ifs, switches and loops repeatedly. I’ve spent more time than I’ll admit pulling hairs over one-off errors that had me worry about the <em>how</em> more than the <em>what</em>. It almost felt like it was sheer luck I got the <em>what</em> right eventually—not very well even then.</p>\n<p>Every class that looked like it represented data had to have <em>getters</em> and <em>setters</em> as a hedge for when you might want to <em>do something else</em> with <em>encapsulated</em> data. It was tedious. Ever since reading the <a href=\"https://domainlanguage.com/ddd/blue-book/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">DDD blue book</a> after college, I stopped exposing everything. Only the bare minimum needed.</p>\n<figure class=\"float-left\" style=\"width: 300px\">\n\t<img src=\"/media/cs-form.jpg\" alt=\"Windows Forms C#\">\n\t<figcaption>Code was shoved into some Form{number}.cs</figcaption>\n\t<figcaption class=\"attrib\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/shokai/3470835562\">C#.NETでForm</a> by Sho Hashimoto under CC BY</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Soon enough we decided to use C# for projects. We used it as another Java, taking advantage of Visual Studio’s Form Designer for WYSIWYG WinForms development. We ended up shoving all our application logic in our custom GUI classes and writing all application behavior in hundreds up to over a thousand lines of event handler code.</p>\n<p>We weren’t exactly taught modern-day software engineering, mind you. It was all about completing diagrams before you write any code—traditional waterfall. Visual Studio <a href=\"http://charlespetzold.com/etc/DoesVisualStudioRotTheMind.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">rotted our minds</a>, that’s for sure.</p>\n<p>That they were having us build whole applications was a head-scratcher. Never mind we had an “Object-oriented design” course after “Software engineering”. Those lessons would have come in handy in taming the complexity of our thousand-liner event handlers. That said, design patterns are advanced concepts in OOP. It’s one thing to know what they are, it’s another to know how they combine together and which parts should go where.</p>\n<p>In the end, most of our school projects didn’t use design patterns much, if at all.</p>\n<p>In fairness to our school, we did have a “Programming Languages” course. It was valuable how it exposed us to other paradigms. It did mention Haskell, FP, and even logic programming languages like Prolog. Schools should be pushing other paradigms like functional and logic <strong>more</strong> and <strong>earlier</strong>. Looking back at how I wasn’t convinced to do FP cements my view FP needs more PR.</p>\n<h2 id=\"some-respite-in-sql\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#some-respite-in-sql\" aria-label=\"some respite in sql permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Some respite in SQL</h2>\n<p>Databases were something else. Learning SQL was eye-opening, revealing a much more intuitive way of gleaning information from mounds of data than just looping over it. This was the feeling I got working through <a href=\"https://sqlzoo.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SQL Zoo</a>. In class, we were taught the Oracle SQL dialect. The Oracle brand reminded me of its namesake in Greek mythology. To quote Wikipedia,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“…a person or agency considered to provide wise and insightful counsel or prophetic predictions or precognition of the future”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I even remember my grandma telling me how I should learn Oracle because word around was it was this big-time, high-paying tech thing. Even my grandma was in on it!</p>\n<h2 id=\"in-sql-we-trust\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#in-sql-we-trust\" aria-label=\"in sql we trust permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>In SQL we trust</h2>\n<p>Our GUI applications were merely frontends to our databases backends. Application logic was just front-end logic, meant to ferry SQL statements over to the backend. We were told to use database triggers to implement key domain logic and keep boundaries consistent. It was good enough. It was a testament to how well-suited database systems were for working on data, and how easy it was to build queries that got us exactly what we wanted.</p>\n<p>Why was this the case? I’d credit it to SQL being founded on solid math, along with the expressive power afforded by its declarative model. I’ve since realized SQL and FP had something in common: being declarative.</p>\n<h1 id=\"into-the-real-world\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#into-the-real-world\" aria-label=\"into the real world permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Into the real world</h1>\n<p>PHP and JavaScript were interesting; They were my first run-in with languages with closures, first-class functions and higher-order functions. But the first language where I started using them heavily was C#. Using LINQ in C# was something that dramatically changed how I viewed programming. I hadn’t realized it but it was my first run-in with monads. I was pretty amazed how I got to essentially write queries within the language (LINQ stands for <strong>L</strong>anguage <strong>IN</strong>tegrated <strong>Q</strong>uery after all). It also turned out I could do it with collections!</p>\n<p><figure class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figure\" style=\"\">\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 675px;\"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 133.4814814814815%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/a57b775d66e7ddea3a7e350e7b9e46db/8ac56/winding-road.webp 240w,\n/static/a57b775d66e7ddea3a7e350e7b9e46db/d3be9/winding-road.webp 480w,\n/static/a57b775d66e7ddea3a7e350e7b9e46db/3bfaf/winding-road.webp 675w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/a57b775d66e7ddea3a7e350e7b9e46db/09b79/winding-road.jpg 240w,\n/static/a57b775d66e7ddea3a7e350e7b9e46db/7cc5e/winding-road.jpg 480w,\n/static/a57b775d66e7ddea3a7e350e7b9e46db/512c0/winding-road.jpg 675w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 675px) 100vw, 675px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/a57b775d66e7ddea3a7e350e7b9e46db/512c0/winding-road.jpg\"\n          alt=\"My long and winding journey towards FP has been one of the avoidance of pain\"\n          title=\"Winding road\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n    </span>\n    <figcaption class=\"gatsby-resp-image-figcaption\">My long and winding journey towards FP has been one of the avoidance of pain</figcaption>\n  </figure></p>\n<p>The more OOP experience I got, the more I realized “good OOP” looked more and more like FP.

Instead of for and while loops, I’ve been using higher-order functions (HOF) in array methods like <code class=\"language-text\">map</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">flatMap</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">filter</code>, and <code class=\"language-text\">reduce</code>. I also expanded my usage of interesting HOFs to those in underscore and lodash. The one that tipped me over to the FP side however was a little-known library called <a href=\"https://highlandjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">highland.js</a>. It was impressive how I could just write a whole Node program as one long stream.</p>\n<p>Something that had been plaguing frontend JavaScript (thanks to AJAX) and Node and for some time was callback hell. It got so bad that I’d sometimes just factor out each layer of a stack of callbacks into its own function. The <code class=\"language-text\">Promise</code> abstraction came along and I was stunned how I could effectively keep indentation in check. Promises were infectious though, use it in one place and soon enough you’re going to have to use it everywhere.</p>\n<p>I didn’t know it then but <code class=\"language-text\">Promise</code> was an <a href=\"https://buzzdecafe.github.io/2018/04/10/no-promises-are-not-monads\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">almost monad</a>. The arrival and widespread adoption of generators and <code class=\"language-text\">async</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">await</code> syntax wasn’t going to happen until a few years later.</p>\n<h1 id=\"teaching-myself-fp\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#teaching-myself-fp\" aria-label=\"teaching myself fp permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Teaching myself FP</h1>\n<p>Around 2015, I was sold on FP.

I have to admit I had been mostly dismissive of Akka’s actor model because it wasn’t the model of composability I was getting used to. Later on, I learned of the strength of actors in modeling system boundaries, and its suitability for distributed systems. Indeed, <a href=\"https://blog.softwaremill.com/scalaz-8-io-vs-akka-typed-actors-vs-monix-part-1-5672657169e1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">“Akka is much more than just actors; there’s streaming, persistence and clustering, just to name the three most popular modules.”</a>, and it has gotten much better at composition.</p>\n<p>Something I’ve been finding out over time however, was a problem with Akka: its reliance on Scala’s problematic built-in <code class=\"language-text\">Future</code>.

It was pretty straightforward and pleasant to read Eugene Yokota’s <a href=\"http://eed3si9n.com/learning-scalaz/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Learning Scalaz</a>. I learned it around the point when iteratees were <em>the</em> abstraction for purely functional stream processing. Another great book on Scalaz, <a href=\"https://leanpub.com/fpmortals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Functional Programming for Mortals</a>, came out in 2018. I think many functional Scala users will agree it’s easier to go straight to learning Scalaz or Cats than <a href=\"#the-red-book-functional-programming-in-scala\">FPiS</a>. <a href=\"https://typelevel.org/cats/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Cats</a> was a fork of Scalaz that has come into its own as a core library in the vibrant <a href=\"https://typelevel.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Typelevel ecosystem</a>.

How do I do domain modeling? How does the DDD I learned while working in an OOP paradigm translate to FP? I turned to Debashish Ghosh’s <a href=\"https://www.manning.com/books/functional-and-reactive-domain-modeling\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Functional and Reactive Domain Modeling</a>. Great book. It helps bridge the gap between knowing FP and using it in projects.</p>\n<p>Another question I started asking: how was I supposed to go about putting various functional effects together? <code class=\"language-text\">Either</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Option</code> are great. <code class=\"language-text\">Reader</code> can be pretty handy. All these effects are nice and all but when using them together, it can get pretty hairy—especially when using them to write sequential code. This is because monads don’t compose. Monad transformers, the would-be band-aid to this, aren’t exactly known for their ergonomics and performance. Also, free monads just come with a lot of boilerplate. Not to mention they work better in some domains (think <a href=\"http://scala-slick.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Slick</a>, <a href=\"https://tpolecat.github.io/doobie/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Doobie</a>) than others. Over time I felt I had to look at some other ways to do pure FP.</p>\n<h3 id=\"eff-and-tagless-final\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#eff-and-tagless-final\" aria-label=\"eff and tagless final permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Eff and Tagless Final</h3>\n<p>FP can be hard in its own way. Sure, OOP/imperative spaghetti code bases are harder but FP can get pretty verbose and messy. When I was learning <a href=\"https://atnos-org.github.io/eff/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Eff</a>, I wrote <a href=\"/posts/eff-in-context\">another article</a> on it in the context of other FP approaches. Touted as an alternative to monad transformers, it offered a better way to put effects together. Granted, the typings can get arcane. It does have a great adoption story in Zalando though. It’s up there among my favorite IO effects in Scala today, along with Monix and ZIO.</p>\n<p>While getting my hands dirty with Functional and Reactive Domain Modeling, I remember chapters went by where the author would replace a domain service’s effect type from <code class=\"language-text\">Try</code>, to <code class=\"language-text\">Future</code>, to <code class=\"language-text\">Kleisli</code> (which we write the <code class=\"language-text\">Reader</code> monad in terms of), and some others I may have missed. To me it begged the question: what if I could just parameterize my domain logic over some <code class=\"language-text\">F[_]</code> that I could bind to as late as possible? I experimented with the idea and eventually found out it was a part of a thing that had a name: tagless final. My current take on it is while there are benefits to using the principle of least power which tagless final allows you to write your domain logic with, the typeclasses one uses had better come with some laws. Then again, I don’t have any professional experience using tagless final and neither have I used it in production for some non-trivial project so my opinion could still very well change. </p>\n<p>Not related to programming or anything technical, but I fell into a rut around this time in my FP journey. I hadn’t been productive and I often found myself drained and not being able to code. Just opening my projects was taxing.</p>\n<p>I had read about ZIO around this time from Mateus Kubuszok’s excellent article on <a href=\"https://kubuszok.com/2019/io-monad-which-why-and-how/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">IO monads</a>. It got me curious enough to check ZIO out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"zio\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#zio\" aria-label=\"zio permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://zio.dev\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ZIO</a></h3>\n<p>What can I say? I was impressed. It has gotten to be my favorite functional effect right now. It has been a pleasure coding in it. I love that you can do pretty much anything in ZIO without having to know what a Coyoneda is (I still don’t know).</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, it helps to know typeclasses. It helps to know stuff like monoids, functors, applicatives, monads, traversables, and foldables. But there’s something to be said about just using those typeclasses implicitly in your code (not Scala implicits) or as John De Goes would put it, “stealth FP”.</p>\n<p>FP can be verbose at times, like an animé character calling out their every move. ZIO is the character that bucks the trend and just does it.</p>\n<p>Overall, I believe it’s a perfect fit for Scala’s language features with just the amount of type information—all the while making practical FP very accessible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"looking-forward\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#looking-forward\" aria-label=\"looking forward permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Looking Forward</h3>\n<figure class=\"float-right\" >\n  <img src=\"/media/scala-logo.jpg\" />\n  <figcaption>I mean come on, that's such a cool logo</figcaption>\n  <figcaption class=\"attrib\">\n    <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/99087984@N00/5247567841\">\"scala-lang-logo\"</a> by alejandrocrosa <br/>under CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\n  </figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23scalaThankYou\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">#ScalaThankYou</a> is in order here.

To this end I’m looking to continue my FP journey by sharing what I’ve learned so far with people in my country. I couldn’t turn up any metrics, but my hunch is that the development culture here is still pretty much dominated by procedural and OOP, with languages such as PHP and JavaScript.
