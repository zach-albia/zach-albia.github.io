I'm a dude from a faraway land called the Philippines whose current professional
interest just happens to be the 𝕞𝕪𝕤𝕥𝕚𝕔𝕒𝕝 𝕒𝕣𝕥 of typed functional programming.
Now, that we've got the token oriental mysticism away: I'm a big fan of Scala,
Haskell is kinda like that cute barista chick at the coffeeshop whose number I'd
like to ask but am too shy to. I dunno if functional programming is the final
frontier (probably isn't) but it's been a pretty great experience immersing
myself in it so far. ᴵ ᵏⁱⁿᵈᵃ ⁿᵉᵉᵈ ᵃ ʲᵒᵇ. Srsly though, help me get a foot in the
door of the pure functional programming world and I'll help you make something
to write home about.
