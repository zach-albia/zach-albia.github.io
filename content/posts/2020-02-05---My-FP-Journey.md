My first programming language was this odd thing called Scheme, taught to us in
the first half of my second year of high school. There was this cute lambda
symbol emblazoned on the shortcut to what I remember to be its IDE with a REPL.
Come to think of it, I'm pretty sure it was called
[Dr. Scheme](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs009/02/drscheme_intro/scheme.html)
then.

It was weird. I had to come to terms with the peculiar way it specified
operations and their arguments in what I was later taught was _prefix notation_.
We were then taught to do arithmetic, define variables and functions. We got far
enough into it to make programs that would calculate averages, and maybe
calculate some school grades for our final practical exam. But that was pretty
much it, and we only spent a semester on it.

One thing that stuck to me was how there was this perception among my class that
Scheme was just this toy language you couldn't make anything interesting with.
Oddly enough, there had been these card game apps that appeared to be a part of
the Scheme installation. We were quite content playing them while regarding
Scheme as a toy language.

For us, scheme just wasn't seen as something suitable for real™ programming.

# To the land of nouns we go!
- We were taught Java in senior year and college.
- Java was all about all this ceremony, bureaucracy, and verbosity. 
- Getters and setter were annoying.
- Spent too much time pulling hairs over one-off errors
- C# just more Java

# Some respite in SQL
- We were taught SQL, database normalization, ACID
- Learning SQL was eye-opening, revealing a much more intuitive way of gleaning
  information from mounds of data
- The Oracle brand connected to me like its namesake in Greek mythology
- To quote Wikipedia, "a person or agency considered to provide wise and
  insightful counsel or prophetic predictions or precognition of the future"
- Even my grandma was in on it!

## In SQL we trust
- Projects were written mostly in SQL
- Application logic was just "front-end" logic, meant to give, pass SQL
- Database triggers

# A dalliance with PHP and JavaScript
- PHP, as a platform, doesn't have a very good reputation .

# The Salt Mines
- C# LINQ was a candle in the dark
- Probably my first run-in with monads, before I even knew what they are
  
# A Way Out
- The more experience I got, the more I realized "good OOP" looked more and more
  like FP.

## Rediscovering JavaScript
- Has higher order functions built-in.
- Lodash, Highland.js, impressed with productivity in using higher 
- Promises (A sort of monad, in retrospect)

  "If only I had known how great FP was from the start"
)

## Groovy
- GPars
- actors
- toying with parallelism
- Eventually ended up knowing about the existence of Scala

# Node JS

# Scala

# The beauty of FP
- Not juggling many things at once
- Mostly concerned with what goes in, what goes out, and how to put things together.

## Why not Haskell?
- I want a job.
- Scala is in a good place right now.
- Would love to learn it soon, when the "time is right™".
